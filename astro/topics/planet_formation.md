### Topics

* 



### Modeling and Simulating code packages

* Hydrodynamic and MHD Simulation as well as N body code packages, see [Astrophysical and cosmological numerical simulations](https://github.com/dr-guangtou/taotie/blob/master/astro/topics/simulations.md).

* [The PLUTO code](http://plutocode.ph.unito.it/): a freely-distributed software for the numerical solution of mixed hyperbolic/parabolic systems of partial differential equations (conservation laws) targeting high Mach number flows in astrophysical fluid dynamics.
* [FARGO3D](https://fargo3d.bitbucket.io/): a hydrodynamics and magnetohydrodynamics parallel code. It is the successor of the public [FARGO code]([http://fargo.in2p3.fr](http://fargo.in2p3.fr/)).
* [The Pencil code](http://pencil-code.nordita.org/): a high-order finite-difference code for compressible hydrodynamic flows with magnetic fields.
* [Phantom](https://phantomsph.bitbucket.io/): a fast, parallel, modular and low-memory smoothed particle hydrodynamics and magnetohydrodynamics code developed over the last decade for astrophysical applications in three dimensions.
* [ChaNGa](https://github.com/N-BodyShop/changa): a code to perform collisionless N-body simulations. It can perform cosmological simulations with periodic boundary conditions in comoving coordinates or simulations of isolated stellar systems. It also can include hydrodynamics using the Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) technique.
